# Web Enumeration  

## Subdomains  

### SSL/TLS Certificates  

One way to find subdomains is by looking at TLS/SSL records from past/present which are publicly listed as a way to verify authenticity. Records can be found at these resources:  

- http://crt.sh/
- https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/certificates


### Brute Forcing  

Most common. There are many tools that do this. Essentially, an application sends many requests per second to different subdomains, and returns existing results based on their responses. 

One common tool for this is **dnsrecon**.  

### Dorking  

Google Dorking is a popular term that was coined for the act of enumerating websites via Google search filters. This can be done with other search engines, such as Bing.  

Example:  

```
-site:www.domain.com site:*.domain.com
```  

### Automation  

Subdomain enumeration can be automated as well, using tools such as [Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r). This tool can discover subdomains using SSL certificate searches, search engine filtering and other methods.  

### Virtual Hosts  

Can use ffuf to fuzz for subdomains in virtual hosts:  

```bash
Run first, identify common size to remove from next scan: 
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.acmeitsupport.thm" -u http://10.10.207.76

Then, after we see most results have size 2907, remove this by supplying this value for 'fs':

ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.acmeitsupport.thm" -u http://10.10.207.76 -fs 2907
```
