I launched this cyber blog during Spring 2022 as an effort to give back to the cybersecurity community while additionally making my life easier. The mission is two-fold: 
this website serves as a resource for myself as much it does others.    

My computer/cyber hobbies typically revolve around:  

- Enhancing my current software toolbox or hardware setup  
- Programming/Scripting (sometimes in AWS) with Python, Java, Bash, SQL  
- Competing in CTF Challenges  
- And sharpening my ethical hacking skills via TryHackMe, HackTheBox, Portswigger Academy, etc.  


Please reach out through the listed social media links if you have any comments/questions/suggestions about the content of this webpage.
