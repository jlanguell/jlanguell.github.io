I launched this cyber blog during Spring 2022 as an effort to give back to the cybersecurity community while additionally making my life easier.  

My computer/cyber hobbies typically revolve around: 
	Enhancing my current software/hardware setup; 
	Programming languages such as Python, Java, Bash, SQL;  
	And concepts like OSINT, Vulnerability Detection, Exploit Development, & Network Log Analysis.
